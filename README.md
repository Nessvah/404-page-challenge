- Tried to build the webpage with the mobile-first approach but had a hard time fixing the layout once on the bigger screen.
- Had some difficulty in maintaining the footer on the bottom of the viewport.
- Used flexbox to practice.
- Overall and despite some trouble with the layout, I think that the outcome is exactly how it was expected to be.

This webpage was deployed with Netlify.
